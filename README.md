Loan Default Prediction is my third project at Metis. 

In this project, I performed some classification algorithms:

• Stored Lending Club's loans data on PostgreSQL 

• Performed Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms on the loan dataset

• Chose Logistic Regression as the best model, optimized it, and predicted whether a loan of Lending Club will default or not 

Data is from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

Language: Python

Libraries: sklearn, pandas, matplotlib
